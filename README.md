# movie-ios
Sample app that fetches movies from TMDb API to display movies in:
Movie List screen
Movie Detail screen

Libraries used (Through CocoaPods)
Alamofire: Networking calls
SDWebImage: Image fetching and display
SnapKit: Programmatic UI layout
ReSwift: Unidirection data flow architecture
RxSwift: Bindings for certain UI actions

Other notes:
Used RxSwift quite sparingly as I'm quite inexperienced with it
Used a Redux-like architecture for the data, using ReSwift
Included a few XCTestCases to test the actions and reducers
